# File Tree for Credit-Based Ad Unlock System

This file tree enhances the *TradeCraft.Lifestyle* platform with ad buttons that award credits toward a $4.99/month subscription or $49 eBook, using a reward system. Hosted on GitHub Pages (e.g., `vip.tradecraft.lifestyle`), it leverages GitHub Codespaces for $0 budget development and Cloudflare Workers for backend, complying with legal standards (18 U.S.C. §2511, §798, BIPA, CIPA, GDPR), as of 02:52 AM EDT on Wednesday, July 02, 2025.

### Key Enhancements
- **Frontend**:
  - **ad_unlock.html/ad_unlock.js**: Displays ad buttons (e.g., from AdMaven) and awards credits (e.g., 1 credit per click). Tracks progress toward subscription ($4.99 = 500 credits) or eBook ($49 = 2450 credits).
  - **subscription.html/subscription.js**: Allows users to apply credits toward the $4.99/month subscription.
  - **ebook.html/ebook.js**: Enables credit application toward the $49 eBook.
  - **assets/**: Adds `subscription_icon.svg` and `ebook_icon.svg` for branding.
- **Backend**:
  - **ad_worker.js**: Logs clicks in Cloudflare KV, awarding 1 credit per valid click.
  - **credit_worker.js**: Tracks user credit balance and verifies eligibility for discounts.
  - **discount_worker.js**: Calculates the discount (e.g., 100 credits = $1 off) and updates payment totals.
  - **payment_worker.js**: Processes remaining balance via Stripe after applying credits.
- **Integration**: Credits are cumulative and can be split between subscription and eBook purchases.

### Implementation Details
- **Credit Valuation**: 1 credit = $0.01, so 500 credits = $5 (covers $4.99 subscription with slight buffer), 2450 credits = $24.50 (half the eBook price as an incentive).
- **Ad Network**: Use a network allowing content unlock (e.g., PropellerAds) with clear disclosure: “Earn credits toward VIP content by engaging with ads.”
- **Legal Compliance**: Include a consent popup for ad tracking, store minimal data in Cloudflare KV, and offer a paid bypass to avoid coercion claims.

### Benefits
- **User Incentive**: Encourages ad engagement while providing a tangible reward.
- **Revenue Stream**: Balances ad revenue with subscription/eBook sales.
- **Flexibility**: Users can mix credits and cash payments.

### Risks and Mitigation
- **AdSense Violation**: Avoid AdSense; use compliant networks.
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Ensure consent and data minimization.
- **User Perception**: Clearly state credit value and paid alternatives.

### Next Steps
- **Develop Frontend**: Code `ad_unlock.html`, `subscription.html`, and `ebook.html` with React.
- **Set Up Workers**: Write `ad_worker.js`, `credit_worker.js`, and `discount_worker.js` with Cloudflare KV.
- **Integrate Ad Network**: Test ad delivery and credit tracking with a compliant provider.
- **Testing**: Verify credit earning and purchase discounts in Codespaces.
- **Design Assets**: Create `subscription_icon.svg` and `ebook_icon.svg`.
