# Website Plan: Private Intelligence Agency (GitHub Pages Frontend, Cloudflare Backend)

## Introduction

This whitepaper outlines a website for a private intelligence agency, hosted on GitHub Pages (frontend) with Cloudflare (backend), designed to educate the founder in espionage tradecraft and monetize premium intelligence training. The site emulates EverydaySpy’s professional aesthetic, featuring a secure login (top-right, like EverydaySpy), blog pages, a curriculum centered on tradecraft (e.g., dead drops, elicitation), and rental access to a custom Intel Voice Assistant/Chatbot. Courses/packages have CIA-inspired names, and an eBook/physical textbook, *The Blackstar Manual*, will be sold. All content uses declassified CIA documents and open-source data to ensure legal compliance. The plan balances the founder’s education with profit, targeting \~$97–$497 for courses and \~$29–$49/month for assistant access.

## Section 1: Website Objectives

- **Dual Purpose**:
  - **Education**: Teach the founder tradecraft (e.g., dead drops, SDRs), CIA/global agency history, legal frameworks, and cybersecurity through interactive courses and a voice assistant, enabling practical skill-building.
  - **Monetization**: Sell courses, assistant rentals, and *The Blackstar Manual* to private investigators, security professionals, and espionage enthusiasts.
- **Tradecraft Definition**: Specialized espionage techniques used by operatives to conduct covert operations discreetly, including:
  - **Dead Drops**: Concealing messages/items (e.g., hollow rocks) for retrieval (e.g., CIA’s Tolkachev ops).
  - **Brush Passes**: Discreet exchanges in public (e.g., microfilm in markets).
  - **Elicitation**: Extracting information via casual conversation (e.g., probing diplomats).
  - **Surveillance Detection Routes (SDRs)**: Routes to evade tails (e.g., Moscow operations).
  - **Disguises**: Altering appearance/behavior (e.g., *Argo*’s fake film crew).
  - **Social Engineering**: Manipulating for access/info (e.g., pretexting).
  - Sourced from declassified CIA documents (e.g., Spy Speak glossary, FOIA Reading Room) and open-source OSINT guides (e.g., US Army ATP 2-22.9).
- **Curriculum Scope**:
  - Tradecraft is the core, covering practical espionage skills.
  - Non-tradecraft elements (history, legal frameworks, cybersecurity) provide context, compliance, and modern skills.
- **Revenue Streams**:
  - Courses: $97–$497, tiered for profit (like EverydaySpy).
  - Assistant Rental: $29–$49/month for mission guidance, education, Q&A.
  - eBook/Textbook: $19 (eBook), $49–$79 (physical).
  - Free blogs to drive traffic, upsell premium content.
- **Legal Compliance**:
  - Use declassified CIA docs (FOIA Reading Room) and open-source data (e.g., Bellingcat, ATP 2-22.9).
  - Adhere to PI laws (e.g., W. Va. Code §30-18), citizen’s arrest statutes (e.g., California Penal Code §837), and federal laws (18 U.S.C. §798).
